<br>
<b>Purpose of the Guidelines</b>
<br>
As National Governing Body and steward of our sport, USSA has published this document to assist its clubs, coaches, and team leaders in recognizing unacceptable behavior and acting to prevent or correct it.
These guidelines are not intended to serve as legal advice or to supplant legal definitions of abuse and harassment that vary depending on jurisdiction. Instead these guidelines are designed to raise awareness of areas of concern. If these guidelines raise concerns about behavior you have witnessed, you are advised to notify the child's parents and seek appropriate counsel.
<br>
Definition of a Child
<br>
For the purpose of these guidelines, a child is defined as anyone under the age of 18 years.
<br>
Statement
<br>
*The welfare of the minor child is paramount. <br>
*Children must be protected from harm, abuse, and degrading treatments. <br>
*Parents must be involved in any action taken to intervene in behalf of their child.<br>
<br>
<b>Overview </b>
<br>
These guidelines are intended to raise awareness and:<br>
*Promote Good Practice. <br>
*Provide examples of objectionable behavior and assist in recognition of signs of abuse. <br>
*Urge team leaders to take action.<br>
<br>
<b>Positions of Trust</b>
<br>
Good Practice<br>
*The welfare of the child is the primary concern.<br>
*Be aware that the closeness of the coach/athlete relationship may encourage<br>
feelings that are not directly related to the sport. <br>
*Set out and maintain appropriate boundaries.<br>
*Promote fairness.<br>
*Prevent and correct bullying. <br>
*Treat all children equally, with dignity and respect. <br>
*Give enthusiastic and constructive advice rather than criticism.<br>
<br>
Unacceptable Behavior
<br>
*NEVER enter into a sexual relationship with a child under your care/supervision. <br>
*NEVER use your influence over a child for your own interests.<br>
<br>
<b>Physical Contact</b>
<br>
Good Practice
<br>
*Physical contact is recommended only in support of the following purposes:<br>
 -To develop or demonstrate sports skills. <br>
 -To diagnose or treat an injury. <br>
 -To give appropriate sport massage.<br>
*These actions should only be carried out by appropriately qualified staff.<br>
*Physical contact may be appropriate in other circumstances, as in congratulating a child or consoling a child who is upset. However, always ensure that physical contact is carried out in the open, or in the presence of another supervising adult.<br>
*Remember that interpretations of touching will be affected by factors such as cultural differences, religious implications, relative age, sexual orientation.<br>
*If a child is uncomfortable with physical contact, stop.<br>
<br>
<b>General Supervision</b>
<br>
Good Practice
<br>
*A supervising adult should never be alone with a child in potentially compromising situations, i.e. in a hotel room, bathroom, changing room, locker rooms, etc.<br>
*Mixed gender teams must always be accompanied by male and female responsible adults.<br>
<br>
Unacceptable Behavior 
<br>

*Do not take a child alone on a trip unless in an emergency and with written parental permission.<br>
*Do not enter the room of a child without another responsible adult present. <br>
*Never share a room with a child.<br>
*Discourage sexually provocative jokes or inappropriate touching or conversation. <br>
<br>
<b>Confidentiality</b>
<br>
Good Practice
<br> 
*Where you are close to a child, you may gather very personal information about
the child. <br>
*Try to make the child aware of the importance and implications of the information
he is sharing.<br> 
<br>Unacceptable Behavior<br>
*You should never encourage confidences, or intrude into the private life of the child.<br>
*Maintain appropriate boundaries.<br>
<br>
<b>Integrity</b>
<br>
Good Practice
<br>
*Discourage children from talking offensively about others, but be aware that the child may be trying to describe an instance of abuse.<br>
*Never talk offensively about others yourself.<br>
*Encourage children to obey the rules of the sport, and compete in good<br>
faith, and treat officials and other competitors with respect. <br>
*Emphasize fair play!<br>
<br>
Unacceptable Behavior
<br>
