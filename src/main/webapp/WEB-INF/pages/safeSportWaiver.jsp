<br>
<b>Purpose of the Guidelines</b>
<br>
As National Governing Body and steward of our sport, USSA has published this document to assist its clubs, coaches, and team leaders in recognizing unacceptable behavior and acting to prevent or correct it.
<br>
These guidelines are not intended to serve as legal advice or to supplant legal definitions of abuse and harassment that vary depending on jurisdiction. Instead these guidelines are designed to raise awareness of areas of concern. 
<br>
USSA considers all coaches, officials, staff and club leadership to be "mandatory reporters" to appropriate authorities (police or child protective services bureaus) if child physical or sexual abuse is suspected.  
If such conduct is suspected, it is not your responsibility to investigate, rather report your suspicions to the authorities immediately.
<br>
Definition of a Child
<br>
For the purpose of these guidelines, a child is defined as anyone under the age of 18 years.
<br><br>
<b>Types of Misconduct Prohibited by USSA</b>
<br><br>
Here we identify six primary types of misconduct:
<br>
<li>Sexual Misconduct, including Child Sexual Abuse</li>
<li>Emotional Misconduct</li>

<li>Harassment</li>

<b>A. Application</b>

USSA employees, coaches, officials, volunteers, board members, committee and task force members, and other individuals in a position of authority over minors (hereinafter "constituents").
<br><br>
<b>B. Commitment to Safety</b>
<br><br>
The USSA is committed to creating a safe and positive environment for athletes' physical, emotional and social development and to ensuring that it promotes an environment free of misconduct.
<br>
The USSA recognizes that the process for training and motivating athletes will vary, but it is nevertheless important for everyone involved in sport to support the use of motivational training methods that avoid misconduct.
<br><br>
<b>C. Prohibited Contact</b>
<br><br>
Constituents shall refrain from all forms of misconduct, which include:
<br><br>
<li>Child sexual abuse</li>

<i>Comment</i>
<i>Activities that fit that definition of hazing are considered to be hazing regardless of an athlete's willingness to cooperate or participate.</i>
<br><br>
<b>D. Willfully Tolerating Misconduct</b>
<br>It is a violation of this Safe Sport Policy if a constituent knows of misconduct, but takes no action to intervene on behalf of the athlete(s), participant(s), staff member, and/or volunteer.
<br>
<b>E. Reporting</b>
<br>
Although these policies are designed to reduce child sexual abuse and other misconduct, it can still occur. Violations of the Safe Sport Policy shall be reported pursuant to our Reporting Policy and will be addressed under our Disciplinary Rules and Procedure.
<br><br>
<b>As a matter of policy, the USSA does not investigate suspicions or allegations of child physical or sexual abuse, or attempt to evaluate the credibility or validity of such allegations, as a condition of reporting suspicions or allegations to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Reporting Policy</b><br>
<br>Every constituent must report to USSA Legal Counsel anatt@ussa.org: <br>
<br>&nbsp;(1) violations of the USSA's Safe Sport Policy other than child physical or sexual abuse. 
<br><br><b>As a matter of policy, the USSA does not investigate suspicions or allegations of child physical or sexual abuse or attempt to evaluate the credibility or validity of such allegations as a condition for reporting to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Reporting Child Physical or Sexual Abuse</b>
<br><br>
<b>Child Physical or Sexual Abuse</b><br>
Constituents are required to report rumors, suspicions or allegations of child sexual abuse to:
<li><b>Appropriate law enforcement authorities.</b>
<br><br>
<b>CONFIDENTIALITY, ANONYMOUS REPORTING AND BAD-FAITH ALLEGATIONS</b>
<br><br>
<b>Confidentiality</b>
<br>
To the extent permitted by law, and as appropriate, the USSA will keep confidential the complainant's name on request, not make public the names of potential victims, 
the accused perpetrator or the people who made a report of child physical and sexual abuse to the authorities.
<br><br>
<b>Anonymous Reporting</b>
<br>The USSA recognizes it can be difficult to report an allegation of misconduct and strives to remove as many barriers to reporting as possible.
<br><br><b>However, anonymous reporting may make it difficult for the USSA to investigate or properly address allegations.</b>
<br><br>
All suspicions of child physical or sexual abuse will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
<br>
<br><b>No Retaliation</b>
<br>Regardless of outcome, the USSA will support the complainant(s) and his or her right to express concerns in good faith. 
The USSA will not encourage, allow or tolerate attempts from any individual to retaliate, punish, allow or in any way harm any individual(s) who reports a concern in good faith. Such actions against a complainant will be considered a violation of this policy and grounds for disciplinary action.  
Any allegations of retaliation should be reported using the same process as for reporting an initial concern.  
<br>
<br><b>Bad-Faith Allegations</b>
<br>A report of abuse, misconduct or policy violations that is malicious, frivolous or made in bad faith is prohibited. Such reports will be considered a violation of this policy and grounds for disciplinary action. 
Depending on the nature of the allegation, a person making a malicious, frivolous or bad-faith report may also be subject to civil or criminal proceedings.
<br><br>
In the event you have any questions about these guidelines or wish to discuss or report any a suspected violation of these guidelines please contact USSA's Legal Counsel at anatt@ussa.org.
